# Remaking [Malleus Goblinificarium](https://ampersandbear.itch.io/malleus-goblinficarium) w/ React and Redux

This Project exists as motivation to learn Redux and and gain a deeper understanding of React.
We're remaking a dice combat roguelike, without the use of a canvas, simply divs, css, and js.
